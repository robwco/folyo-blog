It would be hard to cover everything in a single post, so this will be a two-parter. In this first part I'll focus on our marketing strategy, while the second part will cover the technical details of how we actually wrote and published the book. 

## Email Marketing

The most effective online marketing strategies usually have email at their core, for two simple reasons: it's universal, and it *works*. 

Not everybody is active on Facebook or on Twitter, but virtually anybody online has an email address. And email is still the most effective way by far to grab someone's attention and get them to take action.

An ebook's email marketing strategy is pretty straightforward, and can be summed up in 3 steps:

1. Get people's emails.
2. Make them want to buy your book.
3. Sell them your book. 

There is no trick to collecting emails. You just have to set up a landing page and start driving traffic to it. It will probably be slow and painful, but the good news is that you don't need huge numbers to build a valuable list: even 500 subscribers is enough to show that there's an audience interested in what you have to say. 

The other function of collecting emails is getting validation for an idea. For *Discover Meteor*, we actually started collecting emails before we had written a single line of the book, via a subscription form on the [Telescope](http://telesc.pe) homepage. We only took the plunge and started to work on the book once we were sure that there was a clear demand for it. 

By the time we actually released the book, we had about 2000 subscribers. Perhaps a small number for a startup's user base, but for us it was enough people to ensure revenue in the five figures in our first 24 hours. 

While steps 1 and 3 are obvious, step 2 is a little trickier. Getting people to give you their email is a great accomplishment, but it's only the first step of the long and arduous process of converting them to paying customers. 

When a customer gives you their email, it doesn't necessarily mean they want to buy your product: all it means is that they're giving you permission to make your case. 

The best way to do this is to email people at regular intervals (say, every 10 days). Possible topics include:

- News about your product.
- Links to other resources.
- Questions or polls to engage your audience.
- Giving out free stuff (like exclusive preview chapters of your book).

To give you a concrete example, here's all the emails we sent leading up to the book's launch:

## Press Strategy

There are countless posts out there on how to get coverage from the tech press, and they basically all boil down to connecting personally with tech journalists over time. 

Sadly, when it comes to ebooks, this advice won't help you much. Unless you're already famous in tech circles, chances are that none of the tech blogs will care much about your ebook (even though it might very well end up generating more income than 99% of startups).

The good news is that this doesn't really matter, because you don't want to reach that audience anyway. Instead, you should focus on two things: book reviews and guest posts. 

About two weeks before *Discover Meteor*'s launch date, I started contacting blogs (as well as individual bloggers) asking them if they'd be interested in reviewing the book in exchange for a free copy. 

To find these leads, I simply googled for people who had already written about Meteor, or more generally blogged about JavaScript. Meteor was still pretty niche at that time so it wasn't always easy to find people willing to review the book, but I still managed to get a couple volunteers. 



## Pricing

Pricing is a topic in itself, and has already been the subject of countless posts (both by me and by others), so I'll only touch on it briefly.

For *Discover Meteor*, we decided early on to offer three packages in order to benefit from market segmentation. But as the launch date was coming up, we had a problem: we only had enough material for two tiers. 

We were faced with a tough choice: water down the packages to get our three options, or launch without a premium package and lose out on revenue. 

Instead, we chose a third way: launch with our two existing packages, but let people preorder the third one. 

This turned out to be a great idea: we ended up getting about xxxx preorders, before we had even decided what would actually *be* in that premium edition!

For me, that experience confirmed that having multiple packages is one of the most reliable way of increasing revenue. 

Of course, coming up with the material for multiple pacjages isn't always easy. In our case, we ended up spending about $2400 to hire people such as Chris Mather and Andrew XYZ to film screencasts for us, but the investment was definitely worth it. 

We also decided to price the book at the higher end of the spectrum. After having been on both sides of the price high vs price low debate, I can say that the answer is, as usual: it depends. 

In our case we knew the book was targeting a rather small audience, and teaching them a very valuable (and easy to monetize) skill, two reasons to charge a higher price. 

If you want to hear more about pricing (and ebook marketing in general), I recommend checking out the free self-publishing hangout I recently did with Nathan Barry, Paul Jarvis, and Justin Jackson. 

And if two hours of ebook talk is too long for you, Justin has also published the best parts in his excellent Product People podcast. 

In part two of this article, I'll cover more technical details, such as: 

- Which software we used to write and collaborated on the book (the answer might surprise you).
- Why we wrote a Meteor app from scratch just to host the book (and why we agonized over whether or not we should).
- How we used the Gumroad and MailChimp APIs to give ourselves marketing superpowers. 

The best way to be informed when part two is out is simply to sign up to our mailing list right below. And as a bonus, you'll also receive a chapter of the book for free!
