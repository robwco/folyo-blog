A recent [Hacker News thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4710657) pointed out that [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) used [99Designs](http://99designs.com/) to crowdsource their logo. As usual when somebody mentions 99Designs, this prompted a lively debate on the evils of spec work.

But setting morals and ethics aside for a moment, you can't ignore the appeal of 99Designs' promise of cheap, good-enough design. So I thought it would be interesting to explore the different options out there when it comes to design that doesn't break the bank.

Here's a quick summary:

*   **$0:** Use a free framework and UI freebies
*   **$0-$100:** Get a pre-made theme and nice typeface
*   **$100-$500:** Consider crowdsourcing
*   **$500-$1000:** Crowdsourcing or freelancers?
*   **$1000-$10000:** Get a good designer
*   **$10000+:** Agencies

Read on to get a more detailed overview.

### $0

First of all, when it comes to design you can get a lot done for free. Frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) give you a good base to start off and will take care of basic typography and layout choices for you.

Designers also often share [UI elements](http://ui-cloud.com/) as [freebies](http://sachagreif.com/the-design-freebies-list/), and if you know where to look you can even find some that are [already coded](http://www.webinterfacelab.com/snippets). Of course, as usual with freebies you'll have to pay attention to the license.

I suggest getting in touch with the creator before you use something commercially, but in my experience designers are generally happy to see their work put to use.

### $0-$100

If you can invest even just a hundred bucks, a lot more options open up.

First of all, you now have access to sites like [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/) or [Woothemes](http://www.woothemes.com/), which are an amazing resources of pre-made templates for about $50.

[caption id="attachment_568" align="alignnone" width="570"][![](http://blog.folyo.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-31-at-10.45.26-AM-570x292.png "ThemeForest")](http://themeforest.net/) Themeforest's many themes and templates[/caption]

And don't think those sites are just for WordPress themes. Themeforest has [a huge collection of admin templates](http://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/admin-templates?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;sort_by=sales_count&amp;categories=site-templates%2Fadmin-templates) that are perfect for skinning a web app.

What if you need a logo, too? You won't be able to get somebody to create a logo for you for less than $100, but that doesn't mean you're out of options.

If you're ok with a text-only logo, you can simply make it yourself. [Path](https://path.com/) is a classic example of a startup whose logo is simply its name set in a nice font (in this case, [Coquette](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette/)).

[caption id="attachment_569" align="alignnone" width="570"][![](http://blog.folyo.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-31-at-10.46.42-AM-570x409.png "Path")](http://path.com) Cost of that logo: $29[/caption]

Sites like [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com/) are a great source of professional fonts, and they let you preview a collection of faces using your own custom text. And buying just one font variant usually costs less than $50.

And if you need a visual logo, sites like [GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/) and <del datetime="2012-10-31T09:19:45+00:00">[iStockPhoto](http://istockphoto.com)</del> are also good sources of potential logo material. Sure, those are stock art sites, meaning you won't have the exclusive use of your logo. But for cases where you're just looking to get a landing page out the door, does it really matter?

Note: It turns out using iStockPhoto art as a logo is [explicitly forbidden](http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=616) by their terms of service. Although to me, it's debatable what constitues a "logo" or not. For example, what about using artwork to accompany a wordmark on a single landing page?

### $100-$500

If you're ready to invest a little more (yet don't want to break the bank), that's where sites like [99Designs](http://99designs.com/) come in.

Now although as a designer I personally don't like speculative work and the commoditization of design work, even I have to admit that if you only have $500, 99Designs might be your best bet.

[caption id="attachment_572" align="alignnone" width="570"][![](http://blog.folyo.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-31-at-10.57.01-AM-570x284.png "99Designs")](http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/logo-stackoverflow-6774/entries?filter=allactive&amp;sorting=rating) 99Designs give you multiple options[/caption]

For that budget it's going to be hard to get a good designer to work on your project anyway. So at least with 99Designs, you'll have multiple options out of which you can pick the least bad.

And if you're not sure what you want, the sheer number of different submissions you'll receive can also be an asset. In fact, a common strategy is using 99Designs as a kind of crowdsourced [moodboard](http://viget.com/inspire/behind-the-scenes-mood-boards) to help you narrow down a concept, before hiring a more experienced designer to create the final version.

[caption id="attachment_573" align="alignnone" width="570"][![](http://blog.folyo.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-31-at-11.00.23-AM-570x240.png "BrandCrowd")](http://brandcrowd.com/) BrandCrowd: part crowdsourcing, part stock art[/caption]

Then again, 99Designs is not the only option in that range. For example, [BrandCrowd](http://www.brandcrowd.com/) lets you buy pre-made logos that are generally of a much higher quality than what 99Designs can offer.

**Note**: speaking of 99Designs and cheap logos, watch out for designers who use stock artwork and pass it as their own. [Here's a great example](http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=4721377) straight from the Hacker News comment thread for this very article.

### $500-$1000

This is the tricky gray area. Should you still use crowdsourcing services, or make the jump to hiring a freelancer?

Of course it all depends on what kind of job you need done: branding, web design, interaction design…?

While you can get a good logo for under $1000 (and [Folyo](http://folyo.me) can help you with that), that budget is probably a little short for a full site. So you can go with a hybrid approach, using Bootstrap or a pre-made template for your site but with a custom-made logo.

That being said, my personal philosophy is to either go with something really cheap, or really expensive, but avoid the mediocre middle ground that's neither cheap nor great. So you might also want to simply wait until you can afford to spend a little more to reach that next level of design talent.

### $1000-$10000

You can hire good designers on a freelance basis for anywhere between $1000 and $10000 depending on the amount of work, and that's the budget range where [Folyo](http://folyo.me) excels.

[caption id="attachment_579" align="alignnone" width="570"][![](http://blog.folyo.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-31-at-11.23.51-AM-570x265.png "Folyo")](http://folyo.me/) Folyo is great at finding good freelance designers[/caption]

Compared to 99Designs, there are many benefits to hiring a designer on a one-on-one basis. Not only will you (usually) get better quality work, but the designer will also _care_ about your product.

One of the most valuable thing you can get out of a designer is a fresh point of view and new insights into your product and business, and that can only happen with long-term relationships.

### $10000+

This is the domain of [big-budget agencies](http://www.cubancouncil.com/). If you're reading this, you probably don't want to go there, at least not until you've got a couple rounds of funding safely in the bank.

Compared to hiring a single freelancer, the main difference is that agencies can throw more people at the problem, leading to more point of views and (maybe) better solutions.

But I personally don't have enough experience dealing with agencies to say if their services are really worth the expense. In any case, most of the startups I know prefer dealing directly with individual designers rather than going through agencies.

### Conclusion

As we've seen, there's a lot that can be done for very, very cheap, or even free. There's also a lot of options available when you have a sizeable budget.

Where startups often struggle is in that ambiguous middle ground. Crowdsourcing services might seem like an attractive option, but remember that they're not without risks, and sometimes the best choice is just saving up a little more.

Now I want to hear back from you. What is your design budget like? Have you used any of the options mentioned here? Let me know in the comments or [over at Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=4720863).
