In the past couple years, startups have started realizing that good design can make the difference between success and failure.

As a consequence, demand for designers has risen tremendously, and designer salaries in the Bay Area now routinely break the 6-figures barrier. 

But that's not the world I want to explore today. Instead, I want you to join me on an adventure exploring the jungle of super-cheap, *single-figure* design.  

So read on for an epic tale of lies, deception, stolen work, and crappy logos.

### The Price of Design

First, a bit of background: my own startup [Folyo](http://folyo.me) helps connect startups with a selection of hand-picked freelance designers. Posting a project on Folyo costs $100, and the designer's own fee can often reach in the several thousands of dollars depending on the complexity of the job. 

And note that those are very reasonable rates compared to what it would cost to hire an agency (which is often several *tens* of thousands of dollars) or a full-time designer. 

### A Logo for $5

So you can imagine my surprise when I learned about a site offering design services for **$5**. That site is [Fiverr](http://fiverr.com), and they've built their whole business on the promise of ultra-cheap prices. 

Fiverr seemed to be a direct threat to traditional designers and sites like Folyo: after all, why pay a logo designer $1000 when you could get **200 logos** for the same price? You'd think that even if these aren't all of the highest quality, there would always be a few good ideas among them based on sheer variety alone. 

But it seemed too good to be true: how on earth could someone make a living creating logos for $5? 

I decided to find out for myself by going undercover: I would make up a fake company, hire three logo designers on Fiverr, and see what kind of results I'd get. Best of all, I could accomplish all this for a mere $15!

### Introducing SkyStats

My first task was coming up with a plausible-sounding fake company. I settled on “SkyStats”, a SaaS analytics app for travel sites. 

Don't ask me what “analytics for travel sites“ really is. The important part was that the name was evocative enough: planes, clouds, graphs… For $5, I didn't expect my designers to reach very far to find a good metaphor, so I decided to make it easy on them.

### Bait & Switch

Now for the fun part: finding the three lucky designers who would get the job, and thus receive a princely $5 apiece.

This is when I encountered the first problem. 

While browsing Fiverr, I saw many designers featuring impressive work on their profile. But when I'd browse their on-site portfolio, the quality would suddenly drop after a few pages, going from glossy renders to clumsy clip-art.

<%= figure "blog/fiverr-2.jpg", "From sleek, elegant logos…", "", "" %>

<%= figure "blog/fiverr-3.jpg", "…to this ", "", "" %>

After noticing this pattern on a few profiles, the explanation became clear: these designers were appropriating other designers' work, and passing it off as their own!

This little switcheroo is a big no-no in the design community, and it's obviously quite misleading for prospective clients as well. 

### Hiring Designers

I finally found three designers who weren't stealing other people's work, as far as I could tell, and sent them the following message:

> We’re SkyStats, a two-man startup based in Boston and Tokyo. We’re building an analytics dashboard for travel sites (such as Expedia or Kayak) to help them track visitors, sales, and bookings.
>
> We need a new logo for our upcoming marketing site. We’re looking for something clean and modern that communicates what we do. Maybe featuring a plane or cloud to represent travel?

Now I should mention that although design services on Fiverr *start* at $5, you have to pay more for extra services such as receiving your logo's source files (which is pretty much a requirement if you're hoping do anything useful with it).

<%= figure "blog/fiverr-orderform.jpg", "Ordering a logo.", "", "" %>

Still, my goal was to see what I'd get for $5, so I picked the cheapest option, paid via PayPal, and waited. 

### The Logos

I had to wait 8 days before receiving the first submission:


<%= figure "blog/sk-SkyStats1.jpg", "Sk_virtuoso's first logo.", "", "" %>

<%= figure "blog/sk-SkyStats2.jpg", "Sk_virtuoso's second logo.", "", "" %>

One day later, I received the second designers' logo:

<%= figure "blog/design_expert-skystats.jpg", "Design_expert's logo.", "", "" %>

And I had to wait a full **14 days** before getting the last submission:


<%= figure "blog/depthmixed-skystats1.jpg", "Depthmixed's first logo.", "", "" %>

<%= figure "blog/depthmixed-skystats2.jpg", "Depthmixed's second logo.", "", "" %>

Did I mention that faster delivery was one of the options you can pay extra for?

The logos ranged from expectedly bad to surprisingly good, but I was especially impressed with the submissions from the third designer. 

Not only did he design *two* logos, both of which were quite decent, he also sent along high-quality versions even though I hadn't paid for that option. 

By contrast, the other two designers only sent low-quality images set on a textured background, making it harder to reuse the logo. 

### The Plot Thickens

I should mention that I first posted the results of my little experiment [over at the Folyo blog](http://http://blog.folyo.me/the-5-dollar-logo). Check out the full post to read detailed reviews of each logo, see my own take on the SkyStats logo, and vote on your favorite logo.

The story could've stopped here – with me being quite impressed with my $5 logo – if it wasn't for the comments on that original post. 

That original post amassed a massive thread of over 150 comments. Among heated debates over the validity of $5 design services and a fair bit of name-calling, a few people pointed out something that – now that I look back on it – should have been obvious: my beloved cloud-ribbon logo was **a rip-off**. 

### The $5 Rip-Off

It wasn't a coincidence if my favorite logo looked a lot classier than the average $5 effort. It was actually [derived from a stock template](http://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-photography-cloud-computing-icon-vector-logo-design-template-creative-business-concept-processing-clouds-service-technology-idea-image32344817) with only a few minor tweaks. 

What's more, a quick reverse image search by commenter AimeeD uncovered [example](http://www.cloudbuy.com/) [after](http://www.teknocloud.ca/) [example](http://www.nextlevelinternet.com/) [of](http://www.cloudskill.co.uk/) [companies](http://merchantcloud.com/) [already](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudtelecoms&hl=zh_CN) [using](http://it-manager.pl/cloud-2013-pobierz-raport/) that same exact logo. 

But at least, the *other* logo was a fresh, original idea, right? [Guess again](http://www.123rf.com/photo_25977879_blue-cloud-with-statistics-bar-modern-and-bright-icon-design.html).

What about the second designer's offering? [Nope](https://www.freelancer.com/marketplace/product/Travel-Agency-logo-2.html), [also](http://pantravels-bd.com/) [a rip-off](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/Name-and-logo-for-new-travel-and-tour-company-in-Israel-56482-byentry-2345906.html).

As far as I can tell, the only original efforts were the first's designer's two logos, which coincidentally also happen to be my least favorite of the bunch…

### What You Get For $5

There's [a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXRYtt-8uH8) in Anchorman 2 where David Koechner's washed-up sports anchor character has opened a fast-food joint. 

He defends his choice to pass off fried *bat* as fried chicken by explaining they only serve the "good-quality kind" of bats, and that "you gotta do what you gotta do". 

<%= figure "blog/chicken-of-the-cave.jpg", "The “chicken of the cave”", "", "" %>

And just like the fried bat-chicken presumably would, this whole Fiverr experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.

### Deception

There's nothing wrong with going with a cheaper freelancer instead of hiring an expensive agency, just like there's nothing wrong with choosing McDonalds over a 3-star restaurant.

But people trying to decieve you by passing other people's work as their own, and stock art as original work is another matter altogether. Sadly, this is the kind of incentives you create when you drive price down to such an extent.

After learning all this, I'm more confident than ever that you get what you pay for, and that services like Folyo do have their place for companies that are ready to pay for high-quality, original design work they can be proud of. 

But at the end of the day, we can still take comfort in one thing: as far as I know, McDonalds has yet to try and serve us fried bats…
