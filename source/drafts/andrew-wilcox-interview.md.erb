### On How Meteor Got Started

“There were three of us that were working together in the summer of 2011. We were part of a startup accelerator called Y Combinator in Silicon Valley.

What we saw was, lots of our friends who were building websites for their companies were struggling with a problem. The problem was they had a hard choice. They were trying to build websites that felt as good as Google+ and Facebook that had these rich interactive experiences where the browser felt almost like a desktop application. 

But it turns out that writing those apps takes a lot of time. They were also in a hurry because anybody starting a new product wants to get something out the door quickly and see if it resonates, if they're going in the right direction.

It was an impossible choice. They were trying to develop applications as quickly as possible, but they felt like building those applications in server-side frameworks like Rails or PHP wouldn't give them that user experience, that really delicious feel that they were looking for.”

*In the [full version](http://www.discovermeteor.com), Matt also talks about what makes Meteor different from traditional framework like Rails, Meteor vs [Derby](http://derbyjs.com), and how Meteor will make money.*
