### You Are What You Charge

**Sacha:** Right. So let's recap. By charging more first of all you are earning more money, that's obvious.

You also talked about earning the same and getting more time to do other things. Another benefit I want to point out because it is related to Folyo, is that Folyo is a private site.

So what that means is that I select every designer profile myself. It's a very subjective selection obviously, but I try to be fair and I try to value things like experience and creativity, design skill.

What that means also is that I have to reject a lot of people. I think one of the reasons why I reject some profiles, and why their profiles are not up to par, is because simply they don't charge enough.

Charging a lower rate will force you to limit yourself because you can't afford to spend too much time on a project. You can't afford to make sure everything is just the way it should be. I also honestly think that charging more is going to help you grow as a designer.

**Brennan:** I do not disagree with anything you just said. What I found, and this is kind of a fact of life I think, by now; when you charge more. First off it's going to reflect on you.

If you put in front of me a Kia and a BMW. I'm going to assume that the BMW is –a better example would be a Lexus and a Toyota– I'm going to assume that a Lexus is inherently of higher quality, even though anyone who really looks into it really understands that they are really just the same cars, the Lexus has some better refinements on the inside, but at the end of the day they are both made by Toyota.

So that's one thing, pricing reflects on us. It's almost like a mirror.

The other thing, you talk to any product owner, anyone who has ever charged for a product and they will tell you this, and we tend to miss this as service people. [You will have more problem clients if you charge less](http://sachagreif.com/why-cheap-customers-cost-more/).

The higher you charge the less of a pain in the ass the average client is, and that is so true. It really is. The difference is if I am paying somebody who is really cheap, they are going to be almost like my little slaves. That is how I kind of rationalize and internalize things.

If I am paying somebody a high value, like an attorney, I am going to see them as somebody who knows a lot more then me about what I am hiring them to do. I am going to treat them like an actual consultant. Which is really what we should all be aiming for. The reason I like the term consultant is consulting is by-directional.

As a client I may say to you, "do this", and as a client I fully expect you to a consultant to push back and say, "have you thought about doing it this way instead?".

I know Folio you have a lot of overseas people who are, and by overseas I mean, really, non-western. People who are you wanted to talk about, you bring their prices up. What I can tell you, and this is just because I have worked with outsourced teams in the past.

If you're listening right now and you're in India or Pakistan or in China or something, please don't be "yes" men. That is one thing that is a symptom I think, having worked with quite a few outsourced teams, the mentality is the client wants this, so you just blindly go on with it and do it.

That is one of the things that I think if you want to increase your value, I don't want to say debating, but talk. It should be more conversational, it should be more-well, let's try it this way maybe. Mr. Client, why do you think doing it this way is the best way?

Because a lot of clients aren't perfect, they don't have all the answers. The quicker we realize that, the more we put ourselves in the shoes of a consultant, who is going to weigh and balance the request we were given and try to come up with the optimal solution, the better we'll be in. I mean the more we will be able to charge, the better our results will be and so on.

**Sacha:** Yeah. So let's go back to that for a while. In the design world we have this problem, which is not really a problem but so 99designs and sites like this tend to drive prices down and it's the same with outsourcing and designers in countries with a lower income like India or China. They also tend to charge lower prices.

So a lot of western designers might complain about that and think its going to be bad for them. So what you're saying is, if you adopt that new value-based way of thinking that kind of problem goes away. Right?

**Brennan:** Exactly, because you're being hired not to produce designs. People go to 99designs because they have a spec made up and they want a doer to do it. The reason I would never produce for that website is that is intrinsically not how I work and it shouldn't be how anyone works. I want to be seen as an authority on, lets say, developing custom software. You might want to be seen as an authority on building websites that actually bring the client more value. However that is defined.

An authority isn't receptive to just everything, I mean an authority is going to be giving suggestions and opinions and everything. I mean, ultimately yes, the client has the final say, but I just think there is a direct correlation between people who just...

...And I used to be like this, people who just say yes to everything and don't ever push back or recommend or consult versus the people who do consult and are charging a lot more and are producing better work because the client isn't getting in their way every time. Right.

**Sacha:** Yeah.

**Brennan:** Knowing how to do that, not only just say no to the client, but if you can back that up with reason that is something that I think is so rare and if you can do that, you will be out of that.

**Sacha:** Yeah. I think it all boils down to not being commoditized, right? So in market terms a commodity is something where every item can be exchanged for another item. So one kilo of rice is the same as another kilo of rice. Same for [inaudible 35:59] et cetera. So what you want to do is not be the same as another designer. You want people to work with you because you are you and not because you charge $10 less than the next guy.

I think those are all good ways to achieve that but it's important to realize this from the start, like why is someone going to pick me and not the other guy and why? Once people want to work with you because of you than it becomes also much easier to charge higher prices and adopt that value-based way of charging.

**Brennan:** Exactly. There is only one of you. There are all of these who might be one of you, and if you are in higher demand there is only one item of supply. Right?

**Sacha:** It's like hiring Lady Gaga to sing instead of hiring a singer.

**Brennan:** That is why when I see somebody saying "I'm a ruby developer" and then they're wondering why they can't charge more, that's so obvious. Because I can go to odesk.com right now, type in "ruby developer," and find six dollar an hour ruby developers.

Because when you're a commodity developer/designer, there will be a market threshold. What you're saying by saying "I'm a web designer," or "I'm a ruby developer," is you are saying "I am a commodity." You're not saying why they should go with you, necessarily. You're just saying, "This is what I do."

If I'm a client, and you put two people who say they're ruby developers in front of me, and one is $100 an hour and one is $10 an hour, which one do you think I'm going to choose? That's an easily avoidable path if you present yourself the right way.

**Sacha:** I also think things like blogging and being active on sites like Dribbble for designers, I think those are all good ways to make yourself stand out and make yourself exist as yourself, too.

**Brennan:** I completely agree. One thing that has worked really well for me, if you want to work with small businesses, if you want to work with Dribbble, the people who shop on Dribbble tend to be start-ups. You go out to a user group or a networking event or something like that, you're going to meet people in the real world who have actual problems.

I actually wrote an email to my mailing list, I think it was last Tuesday, or the week before, where one of the things I was talking about was how to do the offline networking thing. What I was saying is, even in a networking event, I'm not going up to people and saying, "Hi, I'm a web developer." What I'm doing is I'm talking with people and I'm asking them about their business. I'm trying to extract out of them what problems they have with their business.

A lot of people aren't actively saying, "You know what? I need new site," or "I need a new logo," or "I need a new whatever built." If you can listen and you can listen to pains that people are having and translate them into solutions, that is an amazing way to invent clients.

That is what has worked for me for the last two and a half years. That's the only way. The current contract I have now, it's $200 an hour, it's a six month, full time contract, which equals a lot of money. When I met the person, when I met the client, he wasn't looking for custom software. He was talking to me about the struggles he had with his current company. Ultimately, what I found out is, he was losing money because he had the wrong things in place.

That's where I come in as the consultant or the advisor and started talking to him about how I, as a consultant, can help him plug that hole that he's built. My medium happened to be writing Ruby on Rails code. Your medium might be redesigning a site that's just hemorrhaging money. That is really the key, I think.

**Sacha:** For example, on my blog, I'm not really looking for freelance work anymore but I just wrote a post about why programming languages' websites are so ugly. I don't think that post will bring me any new clients because people didn't really take kindly to that message. But I think it's an example of how you can reach out to new people and new markets online.

If you wanted to do that, if you wanted to get the chance to redesign the PHP website, for example, you could first of all get in touch with the guys from the PHP website. You could write a post about what you think doesn't work on the site. You can even redesign it yourself. All those things are things that you can do and make yourself stand out and branch out into creating new opportunities for yourself.

**Brennan:** I have seen that happen, you see a lot of those things on Hacker News where people will say, the TripIt iPhone app is ugly therefore here's a redesign.

**Sacha:** Yeah, I saw that you.

**Brennan:** I would only ever do that, honestly if I couldn't get work independently.

**Sacha:** Yeah.

**Brennan:** Somebody starting out that could be a good way to get your foot in the door. However though, it is still a risk, you're still going to spend a lot of time and you might not get anything out of it.

**Sacha:** I bet that you're spending time going to networking events and talking to those guys. So, you're working in a risk with your time to, in a way.

**Brennan:** Yeah. So, I think the differences if you are redesigning TripIt's app, you are probably wanting TripIt to hire you. If you are going to a business networking group you are going to be in a sea of business owners, business owners tend to spend money to make more money. But, yeah I think they are both valid. To put things frankly, the way that I've gotten new business and a last few years is to host user groups, and also to host a conference. Things like that I am really educating people.

I hosted a once a month mixer for business owners who wanted to either create a web startup or wanted to do something online. And by hosting this, what we are implicitly saying, is we are an authority on the subject and we are going to educate you for free. And you're going to get to network with other business owners, so they love that anyway.

If you have local user groups that you can attend, that are just a bunch of developers or designers you should look into them. Look into the quote unquote boring networking groups for guys in ties. You can find, if you are looking for work, you can find a lot of people there.

And if you walk in and you're not saying, I am a web designer, you're not saying I am a web developer, instead you are genuinely conversing with people. Instead of just passing out business cards, converse with people and tried to get to the root of what problems they might currently have with their business, and see if you can offer anything to them. And that is a great way to...And then you don't need to sit back and say, I am just going to wait for somebody looking for Web designer work to approach me.

**Sacha:** One thing I want to point out too, is that like anything else that requires practice. I know that the first couple of blog posts I wrote were not popular in the first redesigns I did were bad. But, slowly you get better, then it starts to be effective. And I'm guessing if you want to organize a meet up or something like this, maybe the first one no one will come. But, if you keep at it slowly it will become an effective way of generating new leads.

It's not going to work right away, it's like anything else. It's never too early to start, basically.

**Brennan:** Persistence and practice are...We all look at people who...Let's go back. I mentioned Jason Freed earlier, we all think, how can I get like that? And then you look back and you realize, 10 years ago they were a small consultancy knocking out a lot of blog posts, and establishing themselves. They weren't overnight success years in the making.

Any of us can do that. You are absolutely right, that first meet up event you might organized, you are lucky to get one person in the door. But, over time if you keep that anything long enough, and you keep practicing, and keep trying to better yourself. I could have written my book if I hadn't been blogging prolifically for [inaudible 46:30] . Because, blogging about freelancing taught me how to write a book on freelancing.

Likewise I'm sure if you, blogging about design helped you write that book.

**Sacha:** Exactly. People already know, there are Ruby developers, they have to put in the time to get good at Ruby. They have to read books, they have to do open source projects. But, sometimes people don't think that it is exactly the same for marketing, for promoting yourself, for learning new techniques on how to think about how you charge. So all these things are also things that you need to work at and you need to get good at.

**Brennan:** Yeah. I mean, here's an experiment for everyone. A/B test your client consultations. If you're afraid of maybe charging more or you want to see what kind of...Like I practice. Each time I get a potential new client, I always try something new, whether it be payment terms...Like the client I have now, this is almost unheard of. I do not do any work until I'm paid in full for the work I'm about to do.

So every two weeks he pays me, prepaid, for the next two weeks of work. And that alone, when you don't need to wear the hat of a debt collector and chase invoices, it is so freeing, and that's really what I told them. You know, I tried to sell it. I said, "What if I told the client that my job is not to be a bill collector and I don't want to do that, therefore you're going to be paying me in advance for everything?" And it worked.

**Sacha:** It's funny that you mention that, because that's exactly the way I've worked for the past couple of years. I charge my clients for blocks of 10 hours, they pay me and then I work the 10 hours, then we see if they liked what I did and they pay me for the next 10 hours. If they don't, then they're only out the cost of 10 hours. And I've always wondered why more people didn't do it like this, because it seems like a pretty safe way of charging and there are no disputes about what you did and all that.

**Brennan:** You can go onto any kind of these freelancer watering holes, right...Like different threads on Hacker News, or Reddit has a subreddit for freelancing...And the same topics keep coming up. How do I get my clients to pay me on time? How do I get my clients to stop being such a pain in the ass? How do I...You know, all these different really vocal...You know, people venting online about [inaudible 49:26] .

And what people need to realize is they are in complete control of that. If you keep getting clients who will not pay your new rate...

**Sacha:** Get new clients.

**Brennan:** Right. I forgot it in verbatim, but Patrick McKenzie or Patti [inaudible 49:51] on Hacker News had a comment a new months back where somebody was saying you can raise your rates by 50 to 100 percent and yes, that might disqualify 50 percent of clients, but who cares? You know, like you move on. Yeah, so that's going to put you out of some people's acceptable threshold.

And I want to touch on one more thing too, before I forget about it. If you can minimize...And this is why people like net 30...If you can minimize the amount of risk that a client...A lot of clients have been burned in the past. They have hired developers or designers who flaked out on them and just kind of disappeared. They never get what they ordered. That is why people are hesitant about prepay, or that is why clients can be such pains.

**Sacha:** Making yourself not a commodity will help to convince them, because they're not just hiring some unknown guy in France. They're hiring Sacha, who has a blog and who has...You know. So I think that's important too, for this reason.

**Brennan:** Well, they know you're not going anywhere.

**Sacha:** Yeah.

**Brennan:** And one thing, in the book I touch on how to do your portfolio site. There's one thing I think that'll really help that, and it's helped me, and that is blogging achieves the same end, but if you aren't a prolific content producer, if your portfolio can be more than just links or pictures that link to other websites...I've seen so many portfolios that are just thumbnails of websites, and you click on it and a new tab opens up with that website. If you can talk...

**Sacha:** Or a 404 because the site doesn't exist anymore?

**Brennan:** Yes, it went out of business and the site's gone anyway. What we should be doing is saying, "This is the problem I was presented with, this is how I went about solving it and this was the end result," and then maybe here's the link to the website. What that's going to tell somebody is that, first off, you're not just linking to a bunch of things. I mean, I've seen people link to clients who have fired them on their portfolio.

If you can convey to people, it's all about risk reduction. If you can reduce the amount of risk that somebody thinks that they...If I'm a client and I'm hiring you. I'm initially unless I got a really strong referral or something else is really cluing me in onto the fact that you are a low-risk, you are going to deliver at or exceeding what you're promising and that at the end of the day that I am going to get what I ordered.

The more you can do that the more leverage you have to having a higher rate because people will always be more inclined to say you know what I am only going to pay you net 30, really terms that hurt us as freelancers come from perceived risk, so the more you can minimize that, the better.

**Sacha:** And it's funny, because when designers design their own portfolio, and that goes for me as well. You never think, "OK, how am I communicating that low risk?" You think, "OK, how am I going to use this font?" or "How am I going to use that kind of color scheme?"

I mean, of course, as designers, we want to think about that, and it's important to think about the visual aspect and what design is all about, but it's also very important to keep in mind that that's not what the client is looking for. And, yeah, minimizing risk, making yourself not be seen as a commodity, those are all the things that will bring in the business.

**Brennan:** That's exactly right. Yeah.

**Sacha:** OK. We're almost an hour. So, to sum things up, what I want to say is that, just like design is a craft that you have to work on, all the things we've talked about, they're not going to come just overnight. So, you should buy Brennan's book. But even though it's a great book, you also need to commit yourself to improving on all those things, right?

**Brennan:** It's going to take time. I can help show you the path you should go down, through something like the book, but the book's not going to make it so you can raise your prices. It's going to ultimately be up to you. So, absolutely. And that requires practice. It requires commitment. And ultimately, that's entirely up to you.

**Sacha:** OK. Well, that's the good news, actually, because when it comes to charging, a lot of the time people seem to think that it's up to the client. And it's not; it's up to them.

**Brennan:** Absolutely. One thing I want to... Well, go on. I'm sorry.

**Sacha:** Oh, I was done, so go ahead. I'll leave the last word to you.

**Brennan:** OK. I was just going to say, I set up a little landing page for Folio listeners. If you go to doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/folio, I've put up a $20-off coupon and put together a little video that I recorded before this interview. So take a look, and if you like the book or if you want to get the book, hopefully the coupon will help save you a few bucks.

But most importantly, please share. Share with me and Sacha if you do end up changing something about your business. If you do end up charging more or adopting a new mindset that is making your life better, let us know about it.

I love the fact that I've gotten a few dozen emails from people thanking us. They've paid me money, and now they're thanking me, which is incredible. I know I'm speaking for Sacha on this, but I would imagine we both want to know that people are doing better than they were before listening to this.

**Sacha:** Yeah, absolutely. If you want me to do other interviews on the Folio blog, or somebody you would like me to speak with, just leave a comment to tell me what you thought of this session and if you would like to see more. Thanks to Brennan for doing this interview. Definitely, go check out his book. If all we've said today resonates with you and inspires you, then his book is the perfect guide to take you along that way. So, thanks Brennan.

**Brennan:** Yeah, thank you.

**Sacha:** Bye.

**Brennan:** Bye.
