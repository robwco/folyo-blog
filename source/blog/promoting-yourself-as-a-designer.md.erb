> Do things, tell people. These are the only things you need to do to be successful. — [Carl Lange](http://carl.flax.ie/dothingstellpeople.html), Game Developer.

Freelance designers don’t lack of advice on how to do things: whether it’s for the print or web, apps or sites you can find tutorial after tutorial explaining the intricacies of design.

But what about the second part of that advice, the “telling people” part? Its importance is often underestimated, but it can have a big impact on your career.

So today I’d like to focus on how you can “tell people” and promote yourself as a freelance designer. 

### Have a Portfolio

This should go without saying, and by that I mean a _real_ portfolio, not a Dribbble or Behance account.

A basic rule: if a visitor can see another designer’s works right next to yours, then it’s not a portfolio.

### Be Part of a Community

Being part of a community and building a following can be very helpful in creating all kinds of opportunities through [weak ties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties).

What’s more, as a freelancer, you don’t have any job security and you must assume that you could encounter a dry spell at any point.

Having a strong network is a form of insurance against this, as it gives you a community to turn to when you need to ask for leads.

So whether you’re active on Twitter, post shots on Dribbble, or share your work on Forrst, the important thing is to avoid being isolated from the rest of the community.

### Help Other People

There’s a ton of people out there who are in desperate need of a designer’s skills, and not all of them can afford to hire a costly freelancer.

I’m not saying you should do spec work or work for free, but you should take the time to answer questions by email or on sites like [Quora](http://www.quora.com) and [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com), give advice to startups, or help friends build their site.

Eventually, all the goodwill you’ll accumulate will translate into people saying good things about you. Plus, helping people can actually feel good!

### Write Case Studies

This is something very few designers are doing, and they’re missing out on a huge opportunity.

Tutorials and article are fine, but people are much more interested in the secrets behind real, live projects.

So after each project, you should write an article on the lessons you learned and the mistakes you made. If you plan this from the start, you can also take screenshots of your work at regular intervals to show the whole process step by step.

I personally wrote such an article recently about [the making of the Sharypic iPhone app](http://sachagreif.com/making-of-sharypic-for-iphone/), and my post about [designing CodeYear.com in one hour](http://sachagreif.com/how-i-designed-codeyear-com-in-1-hour/) was tweeted almost 1000 times!

### Give Out Freebies

Bundles, packs, boxes, sets… No matter what they’re called we can’t get enough of free (or cheap) [design resources](http://sachagreif.com/the-design-freebies-list/).

If you want to get your name out there, don’t hesitate to approach the people behind a bundle to submit your work. And of course you can always give it out on Dribbble or on your own blog.

### Work on Personal Projects

This is probably the most effective and fulfilling way to promote yourself, but it’s also the hardest.

It can be hard to take a break from client work when you need to put food on the table, but working on personal projects can also have great returns, or give you a chance to contribute something back to the community.

For example, last year I took a week or so to create [Patternify](http://patternify.com), a simple online tool to create and export patterns, and I don’t regret it.

### What About You?

What are your tips and techniques to promote yourself? Or maybe you think it’s a waste of time, and you’ll be discovered as long as you do great work?
