If you happent to live in the UK, pick up this month's [.net magazine](http://www.netmagazine.com/) and you'll find a Meteor tutorial by none other than Tom and me. 




The tutorial covers the basics of Meteor by walking you through building a very simple forum app where users can log in and submit posts. It makes for a nice introduction before you're ready to tackle the more serious app we build in the book.

In other .net news, I recently attended the [.net awards](http://thenetawards.com) because a project of mine had been nominated. Although I didn't end up winning, that project was [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io), which happens to be built with Meteor!
