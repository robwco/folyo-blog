The hardest part about learning a new skill is often starting out. You have no context or reference point yet, so you don't even know how much you'll need to learn before you're operational. 




I think this is particularly true for learning to code. Taking that first step can be daunting if you don't have somebody to help you along. 

### Discover Meteor For Free

This is why we've partnered up with Meteor to hold [a meetup for complete Meteor beginners](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-SFBay/events/153719612/). During this free workshop, you'll follow along *Discover Meteor* as we learn the basics of building Meteor apps. 

And the best part is that not only is the workshop itself free, but you'll also get **free acccess to the full book** (see [the full table of contents](https://www.discovermeteor.com/)).

No previous coding experience is required, although basic familiarity with HTML/CSS/JS will definitely help. We do ask you to bring your own laptop though!

### See You There!

So maybe you have a really great startup idea and would like to be able to prototype it yourself. Or maybe you're just curious about this new Meteor thing. 

In any case, if you're interested and you live in San Francisco, come join me at the Meteor offices for the first ever [Discover Meteor Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-SFBay/events/153719612/).
